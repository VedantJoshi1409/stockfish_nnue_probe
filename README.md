## What is it?

A library for probing [Stockfish's NNUEs](https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2020/introducing-nnue-evaluation/). The code for reading parameters and the forward propagation is taken from [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) with modifications to allow for easy access. Currently supports C++ and Java!

## C++ Usage Guide
At engine start up, run ```Stockfish::Probe::init(const char *bigNetName, const char *smallNetName)```\
For evaluation, run:\
```Stockfish::Probe::eval(const int pieceBoard[], bool side, int rule50)```\
 or the faster version:\
  ```Stockfish::Probe::eval(const int pieces[], const int squares[], int pieceAmount, bool side, int rule50)```

## Java Usage Guide
At engine start up, run ```init(String bigNetName, String smallNetName)```\
For evaluation, run:\
```evalArray(int[] pieceBoard, int side, int rule50)```\
or the faster version:\
```fasterEvalArray(int[] pieces, int[] squares, int pieceAmount, int side, int rule50)``` 

## Function Parameter Explanation 

### ```int eval(const int pieceBoard[], bool side, int rule50)```
**pieceBoard** is an array of size 64, where index 0 is mapped to A1, index 1 is mapped to B1, and index 63 is mapped to H8. The value in each index is 
- 0 for no piece
- 1 for white pawn
- 2 for white knight
- 3 for white bishop
- 4 for white rook
- 5 for white queen
- 6 for white king
- 9 for black pawn
- 10 for black knight
- 11 for black bishop
- 12 for black rook
- 13 for black queen
- 14 for black king

**side** is 0 for white and 1 for black\
**rule50** is the value of the halfmove clock, which should be between 0 and 100

### ```int eval(const int pieces[], const int squares[], int pieceAmount, bool side, int rule50)```
**pieces** is an array of size 32 where the first pieceAmount indexes are set to a piece value\
**squares** is an array of size 32 where each  of the first pieceAmount indexes are the square that the piece in the pieces array are on

Ex. pieces[0] is 6 and squares[0] is 4 to represent a white king on e1\
The order that the pieces and squares do not matter, as long as the 2 arrays match each other\
Piece and square mapping is the same as the above method

**pieceAmount** is the amount of pieces on the board

Examples of both function usage are in main.cpp
## NNUE Installation Guide

Install the nets from the [Stockfish Testing Framework](https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns) and put them inside your source directory.

Latest supported big network is **nn-b1a57edbea57.nnue** \
Latest supported small network is **nn-baff1ede1f90.nnue**\
Both are needed!

## C++ Installation Guide

Download everything except for the NNUEBridge files, main.cpp, and probe.dll. Put them in your source directory. The probing functions are in probe.cpp. 

## Java Installation Guide

Download probe.dll and NNUEBridge.java, and put them both in your source directory. The probing functions are in NNUEBridge.java.

If you need to recompile the shared library due to putting the file in a package or something similar, install all files and put NNUEBridge.java where you would like it to be

Run ```javac -h . NNUEBridge.java```  \
Change all function headers in NNUEBridge.cpp to match the ones created in NNUEBridge.h\
Run ```make -j build ARCH=x86-64-avx2 ```\
Then run ```g++ -lpthread -shared -o probe.dll bitboard.o evaluate.o evaluate_nnue.o half_ka_v2_hm.o misc.o NNUEBridge.o position.o probe.o -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/win32```\
Use the new probe.dll that is created

## Future plans
- I plan to implement the Efficiently Updatable part of NNUE in the future as well as clear documentation on how to easily implement it!
- Move some of the code into a singular file as some of the files have only a few lines of code kept from Stockfish
